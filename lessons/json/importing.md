## Importing a library

Create a new directory named **lib** in your project's root directory.

<br/>
Once you've got your folder in place, save the simple-json jar file into the folder. 
<br/>

![select java-simple2](https://github.com/accesscode-2-1/unit-0/blob/master/images/select_json_simple2.png)

You should end up with something like this:

![jar directory](https://github.com/accesscode-2-1/unit-0/blob/master/images/jarsdirectory.png)

Next we need to make sure that our project is aware of this new library by importing it. Go to **File > Project Structure > Libraries > Java**

![libraries java](https://github.com/accesscode-2-1/unit-0/blob/master/images/libraries_java.png)

Select the JSON.simple library that should be located in your `lib` directory.

![select java-simple](https://github.com/accesscode-2-1/unit-0/blob/master/images/select_json_simple.png)

Click 'OK' for it to be imported.

If you now see the following then you're golden.
